P1BG - MVP Project Planning Worksheet

For this project, a client has asked you to make a web game for one of its divisions. You need to plan some basic aspects of the game in writing below, and you‚Äôll speak with instructors to make sure it can meet MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in the two weeks of the course. 

After that, you'll also copy/write these points into the professionally written README.md file that‚Äôs required for MVP (and which is also important for your own GitHub Portfolio of pinned projects üòâ )

Title of Project: Falling Stars

Repo Link: https://github.com/laoloser/jeff-sith-Milestone-Project-1

Description

Star shaped objects will fall down the screen at random, and you must press the corresponding key to each star to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù them, before they hit the ground.

Game Logic

The writing here should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game:


Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
 	- What are the choices available to the player?

Easy, Medium, Hard

- What happens when the player makes a choice?

The difficulty chosen will determine the speed and frequency of stars falling down


Describe the logic that leads to a player winning/closing/ompleting the game.
	Survive 30 seconds without dropping one star, if one hits the ground the game immediately ends

How will a player know they have won, lost and/or finished the game?



	A status page will appear showing they‚Äôve won, or game over.
Also showing total number of stars caught.
